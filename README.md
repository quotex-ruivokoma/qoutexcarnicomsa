# Quotex: A Comprehensive Guide to the App and Its Features

## What is Quotex?

Quotex is a non-regulated online broker that offers binary options
trading. Binary options are financial products where the trader predicts
whether the price of an asset, such as a stock or currency, will rise or
fall within a specific time frame. If the trader\'s prediction is
correct, they receive a payout; if not, they lose their investment.
